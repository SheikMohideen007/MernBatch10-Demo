      The 1885 Daimler Reitwagen made by Gottlieb Daimler and Wilhelm Maybach in
      Germany was the first internal combustion, petroleum-fueled motorcycle. In
      1894, Hildebrand & Wolfm√ºller became the first series production
      motorcycle.[4][5] Globally, motorcycles are comparable numerically to cars
      as a method of transport: in 2021, approximately 58.6 million new
      motorcycles were sold around the world,[6] while 66.7 million cars were
      sold over the same period
